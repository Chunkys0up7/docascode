# Overview

This proof-of-concept demonstrates a graph-based approach to "Documents as Code" for business procedures.

- Knowledge is modeled as a graph: processes, systems, roles, regulations, and contexts
- Procedures are generated dynamically from the graph based on context
- Each step links to traceable sources and reference pages
- Exports produce a browsable static site via MkDocs
