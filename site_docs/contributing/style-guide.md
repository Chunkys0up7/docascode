# Documentation Style Guide

This style guide ensures consistency, clarity, and quality across all documentation. Follow these guidelines when creating or updating documentation.

---

## General Principles

### 1. Write for Your Audience
- Assume technical proficiency but don't assume prior knowledge of this project
- Explain concepts before using technical jargon
- Provide context and examples
- Link to detailed explanations for complex topics

### 2. Be Clear and Concise
- Use simple, direct language
- Keep sentences short (under 25 words when possible)
- One idea per sentence
- Remove unnecessary words

### 3. Be Consistent
- Use the same terms throughout
- Follow formatting standards
- Maintain consistent structure
- Use established patterns

### 4. Be Accurate
- Test all code examples
- Verify all technical details
- Keep content up-to-date
- Include version information when relevant

---

## Voice and Tone

### Active Voice
Use active voice to make writing clearer and more direct.

**Good:** "The system generates procedures based on context."
**Bad:** "Procedures are generated by the system based on context."

### Present Tense
Write in present tense to make documentation feel current.

**Good:** "The function returns a list of results."
**Bad:** "The function will return a list of results."

### Second Person (You)
Address the reader directly using "you" and "your."

**Good:** "You can configure the settings in the config file."
**Bad:** "Users can configure settings in the config file."

### Conversational but Professional
Strike a balance between friendly and professional.

**Good:** "Let's explore how the knowledge graph works."
**Bad:** "Gonna check out how the graph does its thing."

## Formatting Standards

### Headings

#### Hierarchy
- **H1 (#):** Page title - use only once per page
- **H2 (##):** Major sections
- **H3 (###):** Subsections
- **H4 (####):** Sub-subsections (use sparingly)

#### Style
- Use sentence case: "Getting started guide"
- Not title case: "Getting Started Guide"
- Be descriptive: "Configure authentication" not "Configuration"
- Keep headings short (under 60 characters)

### Lists

#### Unordered Lists
Use dashes (-) for unordered lists:

```markdown
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

#### Ordered Lists
Use numbers (1., 2., 3.) for sequential steps:

```markdown
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

#### List Formatting
- Capitalize the first word
- Use periods only if items are complete sentences
- Keep items parallel in structure
- Indent nested lists by 2 spaces

### Code

#### Inline Code
Use single backticks for:
- Variable names: `user_id`
- Function names: `generate_procedure()`
- File paths: `site_docs/index.md`
- CLI commands: `mkdocs serve`
- Short code snippets: `return True`

#### Code Blocks
Use triple backticks with language identifiers:

```python
def example_function():
    """Example function with proper formatting."""
    return "Hello, World!"
```

**Supported languages:**
- `python` - Python code
- `bash` - Shell commands
- `yaml` - YAML configuration
- `json` - JSON data
- `markdown` - Markdown examples
- `text` - Plain text

#### Code Block Best Practices
- Always specify the language
- Include comments for clarity
- Show complete, working examples
- Highlight important lines when needed
- Keep examples focused and minimal

### Links

#### Internal Links
Use relative paths for internal links:

```markdown
See the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide.
See the [Style Guide](contributing/style-guide.md).
```

#### External Links
Include descriptive text, not URLs:

**Good:** Read the [MkDocs documentation](https://mkdocs.org)
**Bad:** Read https://mkdocs.org

#### Link Text
Make link text descriptive:

**Good:** "See the [installation guide](../getting-started.md) for details."
**Bad:** "Click [here](../getting-started.md) for installation."

### Images

#### Format
```markdown
![Alt text describing the image](path/to/image.png)
```

#### Best Practices
- Use descriptive alt text for accessibility
- Optimize images for web (compress, appropriate size)
- Use PNG for screenshots, diagrams
- Use JPEG for photos
- Use SVG for logos, icons when possible
- Store images in `assets/images/`

### Tables

#### Basic Table Format
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Value 1  | Value 2  | Value 3  |
| Value 4  | Value 5  | Value 6  |
```

#### Alignment
```markdown
| Left | Center | Right |
|:-----|:------:|------:|
| Text | Text   | Text  |
```

#### Best Practices
- Keep tables simple (under 5 columns when possible)
- Use headers for all columns
- Align columns appropriately
- Consider lists for simple data

### Admonitions

Use admonitions for important information:

```markdown
!!! note
    This is a note with additional information.

!!! warning
    This is a warning about potential issues.

!!! tip
    This is a helpful tip.

!!! danger
    This is a critical warning.
```

## Content Guidelines

### Page Structure

Every page should have:

1. **Title** - Clear, descriptive H1
2. **Introduction** - 2-3 sentences explaining the page
3. **Main content** - Organized with H2/H3 headings
4. **Next steps** - Links to related pages

Example:
```markdown
# Page Title

Brief introduction explaining what this page covers and who should read it.

## First Major Section

Content...

## Second Major Section

Content...

## Next Steps

- [Related page 1](link1.md)
- [Related page 2](link2.md)
```

### Writing Guidelines

#### Abbreviations
- Define abbreviations on first use: "Model Context Protocol (MCP)"
- Use abbreviations consistently after definition
- Add common abbreviations to the glossary

#### Numbers
- Spell out numbers one through nine
- Use numerals for 10 and above
- Use numerals for technical values: "3 parameters," "5 seconds"

#### Punctuation
- Use Oxford comma in lists: "x, y, and z"
- One space after periods
- Use em dashes (—) without spaces for breaks in thought
- Use en dashes (–) for ranges: "2–5 items"

#### Capitalization
- Capitalize proper nouns: "GitHub," "Python"
- Don't capitalize generic terms: "version control," "static site"
- Follow official capitalization: "MkDocs," "macOS"

### Technical Accuracy

#### Version Information
Include version information when relevant:
```markdown
!!! note "Version Information"
    This feature requires Python 3.11 or higher.
```

#### Code Examples
- Test all code examples
- Show expected output
- Include error handling when appropriate
- Use realistic data

Example:
```python
# Good - Complete, testable example
def calculate_total(items):
    """Calculate total price of items."""
    return sum(item.price for item in items)

# Usage
items = [Item(price=10), Item(price=20)]
total = calculate_total(items)
print(f"Total: ${total}")  # Output: Total: $30
```

#### Commands
Show complete commands with expected output:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Output:
# Successfully installed mkdocs-1.5.3 mkdocs-material-9.4.0 ...
```

# Configure Authentication

This guide shows you how to configure authentication using OAuth 2.0.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Admin access to your application
- OAuth credentials from your provider
- Python 3.11 or higher installed

## Configure Settings

1. Open your configuration file:
   ```bash
   nano config/settings.py
   ```

2. Add your OAuth credentials:
   ```python
   OAUTH_CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id"
   OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = "your_client_secret"
   OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI = "https://yourapp.com/callback"
   ```

3. Save and restart the application:
   ```bash
   systemctl restart your-app
   ```

## Verify Configuration

Test the authentication flow:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://yourapp.com/login"
```

You should see the OAuth login page.

## Next Steps

- [Manage user roles](#)
- [Configure authorization](#)
```

### Bad Example

```markdown
# authentication

Here's how to setup auth.

First setup OAuth. You need credentials.

Then configure:
```
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID = "id"
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = "secret"
```

Restart app.
```
