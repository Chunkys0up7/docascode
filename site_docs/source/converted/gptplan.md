have a look at this document and write a plan to have a proof of concept that shows the full possibilties - use simple tech stack (mkdocs, streamlit, python for exampel) and include the creation of sample data - it should show the full cycle but the purpose is to engage user and get the buy in not to have a robust setup 


ChatGPT said:
Here’s a simple proof-of-concept (PoC) plan based on your document, using a lightweight stack (Python, Streamlit, MkDocs) to show the full cycle in a way that’s interactive, engaging, and convincing — without over-engineering.

Proof of Concept Plan – Graph-Based Dynamic Documentation
1. Purpose
Showcase the full journey:

User enters a natural-language request (e.g., “Underwrite home loan for a client in New Mexico”).

System parses the request → queries a small sample knowledge graph.

Generates a dynamic, step-by-step procedure adapted to the context.

Displays it interactively in Streamlit with visual graph traversal and a document-style view.

Exports a static doc via MkDocs to show how dynamic content can be persisted as reference material.

2. Tech Stack
Python → core logic, sample data generation, simple orchestration.

NetworkX or Neo4j (local) → small-scale knowledge graph.

Streamlit → interactive UI for user queries, graph visualisation, and generated procedures.

MkDocs → produce a static “reference” doc site from generated content.

pandas → mock data handling.

spaCy or simple regex → lightweight intent and entity extraction (no full LLM needed for PoC).

3. Components
A. Sample Data Creation
Create a tiny, realistic knowledge graph for the underwriting use case:

Nodes: Processes, Regulations, Systems, Roles, Contexts.

Edges: Relationships like requires, applies_to, preceded_by.

Example:

Process: “Verify Credit Score” → requires → “Credit Bureau API”.

Regulation: “NM Mortgage Rule 12” → applies_to → “New Mexico”.

Populate with 10–15 entities so it’s easy to demo.

Also prepare mock external data (CSV/JSON):

Credit scores, property types, borrower profiles.

Simple rules like “If property rural → add rural property appraisal step”.

B. Query Processing
Input: natural language from Streamlit text box.

Extract:

Loan type (home loan, refinance, etc.).

Location (state, county).

Borrower flags (first-time buyer, veteran).

Map extracted entities to graph nodes.

C. Graph Traversal & Dynamic Procedure Generation
Traverse from loan type node, pulling in relevant steps, rules, and systems.

Inject contextual adjustments (location-specific rules, borrower-specific benefits).

Output a step-by-step flow in plain English.

D. Streamlit UI
Query Box – type in a request.

Graph View – visualize the traversal path using networkx + pyvis.

Generated Steps – dynamic list showing contextualized instructions.

“Export to Documentation” button – pushes generated procedure to a markdown file for MkDocs.

E. MkDocs Site
Build a small “Knowledge Portal” site.

Pages auto-generated from the latest procedure runs.

Show static but human-readable versions of generated procedures.

Demonstrates how dynamic content can be preserved for reference.

4. PoC Workflow
User Interaction → Enter request in Streamlit.

NLP Light Parsing → Identify entities and intent.

Graph Query → Fetch procedure skeleton from knowledge graph.

Context Injection → Apply mock data and business rules.

Dynamic Output → Show in UI + visualize.

Static Doc Export → MkDocs site updates with the new procedure.

5. Engagement Hooks
Keep visuals clear: colorful graph, numbered procedure steps.

Add “What changed?” notes when different inputs produce different flows.

Allow users to tweak parameters live (change state, add veteran flag) to see instant updates.

Provide a before/after: static PDF checklist vs. live adaptive procedure.

6. Timeline
Day	Task
1	Build sample graph & mock datasets
2	Implement simple NLP + graph traversal
3	Create Streamlit UI with visualisation
4	Add context adaptation rules
5	Integrate MkDocs export
6	Test and polish demo
7	Internal review & showcase

7. Expected Outcome
A clickable, visual PoC that:

Feels intelligent.

Shows adaptability based on context.

Makes it clear how this could scale to enterprise.

Generates excitement and buy-in without heavy infrastructure.

If you want, I can sketch the actual data model & example graph so we can start building this PoC tomorrow — you’d have something you can show within a week.

Alright — here’s a sketch of the data model and sample graph for the PoC, keeping it small enough to build quickly but rich enough to show the full cycle.

1. Data Model
Node Types
Node Type	Example	Purpose in PoC
Process	Verify Credit Score	Step in underwriting procedure
Regulation	NM Mortgage Rule 12	Compliance requirement
System	Credit Bureau API	System of record / integration point
Role	Underwriter	Actor responsible for a step
Context	Rural Property	Special case that changes flow

Edge Types
Relationship	Example	Meaning
requires	Verify Credit Score → Credit Bureau API	Step needs a system/resource
applies_to	NM Mortgage Rule 12 → New Mexico	Regulation applies in a location
performed_by	Verify Credit Score → Underwriter	Who executes the step
conditional_on	Rural Property Appraisal → Rural Property	Step only included if condition true
precedes	Verify Credit Score → Request Appraisal	Workflow order

2. Sample Graph Structure
Here’s a small underwriting example (we’ll load this into Neo4j or networkx):

css
Copy
Edit
[Loan Application] 
   ├─ requires → [Verify Credit Score]
   │                 ├─ requires → [Credit Bureau API]
   │                 ├─ performed_by → [Underwriter]
   │                 └─ precedes → [Request Appraisal]
   │                                ├─ requires → [Property Database API]
   │                                ├─ performed_by → [Appraiser]
   │                                └─ conditional_on → [Rural Property Appraisal]
   │                                                        ├─ applies_to → [Rural Property]
   │                                                        └─ requires → [Special Appraisal Form]
   ├─ requires → [Check NM Mortgage Rule 12]
   │                 ├─ applies_to → [New Mexico]
   │                 └─ requires → [Regulatory DB]
   └─ precedes → [Generate Approval Document]
                     ├─ requires → [Document Gen API]
                     └─ performed_by → [Loan Officer]
3. Mock Data Tables
Borrowers (CSV)
id	name	location	first_time_buyer	veteran	property_type
1	Alice Smith	New Mexico	Yes	No	rural
2	Bob Jones	Texas	No	Yes	urban

Regulations (CSV)
code	description	applies_to
NM-MR12	NM Mortgage Rule 12: additional disclosure requirement	New Mexico

Systems (CSV)
name	type	endpoint
Credit Bureau API	data	/mock/credit
Property Database API	data	/mock/property
Document Gen API	service	/mock/docgen

4. Traversal Example
User query:

"Underwrite home loan for a first-time buyer in New Mexico with rural property."

Steps in PoC:

Parse: loan_type=home_loan, location=NM, property_type=rural, borrower_flags=first_time_buyer.

Start at Loan Application node.

Traverse requires and precedes edges.

Include steps with conditional_on only if conditions match (here, rural property triggers Rural Property Appraisal).

Pull in applicable regulations via applies_to edges (NM-specific rule).

Output ordered steps with role and system requirements.

5. Example Output (Streamlit Display)
Procedure Generated:

Verify Credit Score (Underwriter) — via Credit Bureau API.

Request Appraisal (Appraiser) — via Property Database API.

Rural Property Appraisal — requires Special Appraisal Form.

Check NM Mortgage Rule 12 — via Regulatory DB.

Generate Approval Document (Loan Officer) — via Document Gen API.

Visualisation:

Graph nodes shown with color by type.

Highlighted traversal path based on query.

I can now give you the actual Python + networkx seed file that would create this sample graph and mock datasets so you can plug it straight into Streamlit and MkDocs.
This way, your PoC is immediately buildable.

Do you want me to go ahead and write that Python starter code?

yes

Perfect — here’s a Python starter script that:

Creates the sample underwriting graph in networkx.

Loads mock datasets from inline CSV strings (you can later move them to files).

Includes a simple traversal function that could be hooked into Streamlit for user queries.

python

# sample_poc_graph.py
import networkx as nx
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO

# -------------------------------
# 1. Create sample knowledge graph

for src, tgt, rel in edges:
    G.add_edge(src, tgt, relation=rel)

# -------------------------------
# 2. Create mock datasets

borrowers_csv = StringIO("""

# 3. Simple traversal function
# -------------------------------
def generate_procedure(location, property_type):
    """
    Traverses from 'Loan Application' and includes only steps relevant to location & property_type.
    """
    visited = []
    stack = ["Loan Application"]

    while stack:
        current = stack.pop(0)
        if current not in visited:
            visited.append(current)
            for neighbor in G.successors(current):
                relation = G[current][neighbor]["relation"]

                # Conditional step inclusion
                if relation == "conditional_on" and property_type != "rural":
                    continue
                if relation == "applies_to" and location not in neighbor:
                    continue

                stack.append(neighbor)

    # Filter only 'process' type for the ordered procedure
    procedure = [node for node in visited if G.nodes[node]["type"] == "process"]
    return procedure

# -------------------------------
# 4. Example run
# -------------------------------
if __name__ == "__main__":
    steps = generate_procedure(location="New Mexico", property_type="rural")
    print("Generated Procedure Steps:")
    for i, step in enumerate(steps, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {step}")
How it works
You can run this with python sample_poc_graph.py.

For New Mexico rural properties, it will include:

markdown
Copy
Edit
1. Loan Application
2. Verify Credit Score
3. Request Appraisal
4. Rural Property Appraisal
5. Check NM Mortgage Rule 12
6. Generate Approval Document
The G object is ready for Streamlit visualisation (using pyvis or plotly).

You can easily hook generate_procedure() into a Streamlit input form.

If you want, I can now write the Streamlit app that:

Takes a borrower ID or manual inputs,

Shows the graph traversal path visually,

Displays the generated procedure in numbered steps,

And has a button to export the result to MkDocs markdown.

That would complete the “full cycle” PoC.
Do you want me to prepare that next?
